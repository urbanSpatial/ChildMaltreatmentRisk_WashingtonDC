# Predicting Geospatial Child Maltreatment Risk in Washington D.C.

[This report]() presents results for the Urban Spatial/Predict Align Prevent analysis predicting geospatial child maltreatment risk in the District of Columbia. This document is designed to be read alongside the [Urban Spatial/PAP Technical Appendix](https://urbanspatial.github.io/UrbanSpatial_PAP_TechAppendix/).

The goal of this analysis is to predict latent risk of child maltreatment in Washington, D.C. and create a ‘useful’ tool to help child welfare stakeholders better allocate limited community intervention resources in space.

All the tools required for replicating our analysis can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbanSpatial/spatialML_package).
